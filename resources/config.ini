patchNotes= __Added Events!!__\n-Added the .event start and .event cancel command! This command allows you to start and cancel an event respectively. When this command is executed the bot will DM you for details about the event such as time, max amount of people and much more! The bot will DM you when the event is about start and also when it starts. \n- When an event is created an event message will be posted in the channel that was chosen that contains the details. You can react to the message with :white_check_mark: to accept, :x: to decline and if you are losing your mind trying to decide and you do not know you can react :question: to let everyone know how indecisive you are. When you launch the game the event is on (if applicable) and you are on the accepted members list and you have discord game activity enabled it will display that you are in game! \n- Added the .event link which links to the message of the event.
